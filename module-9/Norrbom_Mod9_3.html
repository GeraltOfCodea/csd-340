        <h2>Chapter 1: Introduction to Ryan Norrbom</h2>
        <p class="intro">My name is Ryan Norrbom and I am currently employed with <span class="sentence">Tillamook County Creamery Association</span>. I work as an Enterprise Artificial Intelligence and Cloud Architect. My day to day involves training other IT members, creating solutions to business problems, automating tasks, and keeping us on-track with our cloud journey.</p>
        <p>Prior to working for <span id="span2">______</span>, I worked in several IT related jobs. Including as a Tier 1 Tech for Apple, Huntsman Cancer Instituite, and OHSU Foundation. In addition, I spent time in a manager role at <span id="span1">______</span> and Papa Murphy's.</p>
        <p>I have two kids and have been married for nearly nine years. We moved to <span id="span3">______</span> in late 2016, starting in the <span id="span4">______</span> area, then later moving to the coast. </p>
        <p>Since I am working in a field with software development and technology innovation, I felt that getting my Bachelor of Software Development would help. In addition, since starting in school back in 2022, I have learned valuable skills and feel more confident in my descision making. Attending Bellevue has helped me to acheive more and I have been able to do so while working full-time and having two young kids. </p>
